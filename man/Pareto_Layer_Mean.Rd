\title{This function the expected loss of the Pareto Distribution Pareto(t, alpha) in the layer Cover xs AttachmentPoint}
\usage{
Pareto_Layer_Mean(Cover, AttachmentPoint, alpha, t = NULL,
  truncation = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Cover}{Numeric. Cover of the reinsurance layer. Use Inf for unlimited layers.}

\item{AttachmentPoint}{Numeric. Attachment point of the reinsurance layer.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Pareto alpha.}

\item{t}{Numeric.. Threshold of the Pareto distribution. If t = NULL (default) then t <- Attachment Point}

\item{truncation}{Numeric. If truncation is not NULL and truncation > t, then the Pareto distribution is truncated at truncation.}
}
