Description: The Pareto distribution and the piecewise Pareto distribution 
    are very useful and popular for pricing of reinsurance treaties.
    The package provides utilities that are intended for reinsurance pricing
    actuaries. In particular, the package provides a non-trivial algorithm 
    that can be used to match the expected losses of a tower of reinsurance 
    layers with a layer-independent collective risk model.
