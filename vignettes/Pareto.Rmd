## Abstract

The Pareto distribution is widely used as severity distribuion for reinsurance pricing. In cases where the Pareto distribuion is not flexible enough, sometimes picewise Pareto distribuions are used in practice. The `Pareto` package provides various tools for the Pareto and the piecewise Pareto distribution, including a fitting algorithm that matches a tower of layer losses by picewise Pareto.
