## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the title in the DESCRIPTION file to "The Pareto and the Piecewise Pareto Distribution"
* Added the reference "Ulrich Riegel (2018) <doi:10.1007/s13385-018-0177-3>" in the Description field 
  of the DESCRIPTION file

I have not changed the version number since I have only changed the DESCRIPTION file. I hope this is ok. 
Thank you for looking at my package.
